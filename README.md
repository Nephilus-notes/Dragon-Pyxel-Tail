# The Dragon's Tail

Welcome! The Dragon's Tail is a game about one young goblin's quest to claim their place as an adult by
defeating the Graith Trees that keep the goblins underground and reuniting with their aboveground 
brethren. 

The Dragon's Tail is a point and click game, with no support for any other controller or keybindings at this point.

The dev team consists of:
Me, Charles McCall

1. Adding more abilities - This will differentiate the classes more at the start of the game
2. Adding Magic system 
3. Adding more enemies
4. Adding more statuses
